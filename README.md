2D action shooter using gravitational effects in space. This game was started during a mini game jam with two friends where the keywords got a little out of hand. Without going into the details of how these words were chosen, here is the list of words this game was designed around.

Rope physics

Explosions
Lasers
Food
Water
Jump
Mouse control
Enemy AI
Cut-outs/paper theme
Platforming
Trees
Circles
Anti-physics mechanic

Not the easiest combination of constraints to fit together, but I came up with an idea that I think fits all of them. More information about the game at silversleekstudios.com.
